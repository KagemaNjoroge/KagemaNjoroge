# Hey there, I'm Kagema Njoroge! 😎

I'm a 21-year-old code ninja 🥷, founder of TomorrowAI 🚀, and a relentless dreamer with a caffeine addiction. When I'm not hacking away on Python (my first love 💻❤️), I'm probably ranting about how much I *really* don't like PHP. 

## What I Do:
- 🧠 Building AI-powered solutions to make life easier (because why not let machines do the boring stuff?)
- 🛠️ Creating UltimatePOS to help Kenyan businesses stay tax compliant without breaking a sweat
- 🌍 Targeting the Kenyan market but with my sights set on global domination (muahaha!)

## Fun Facts:
- 💼 TomorrowAI is my baby, and I'm laser-focused on turning it into a tech powerhouse
- 📚 Still a Computer Science student at the [University of Nairobi](https://computerscience.uonbi.ac.ke) (for now...)
- 💡 Big fan of taking risks and dreaming big. Small thinking? Nah, that's not me.

## Side Quests:
- 🎯 Building a startup from scratch
- 🎩 Plotting my next big move (might involve AI, might involve coffee... probably both)

## Random:
- I'm a nerd 🤓, an introvert, and an all-around tech enthusiast. If you talk to me about AI, don't be surprised if I mention Andrej Karpathy.
- The government? Let's just say I'm not their biggest fan... 😅

Thanks for stopping by my little corner of the internet! If you love Python, hate PHP, or just want to chat about cool tech stuff, hit me up!
